## Game Overview

Gobblet Gobblers is a twist on traditional Tic-Tac-Toe. Played on a **3x3 grid**, it adds strategic depth through the use of **nested pieces** of varying sizes â€” think *matryoshka dolls*.

Each player controls **7 stackable pieces**, from small to large.

### Rules of the Game

- On their turn, a player can:
  - **Place** a piece on an empty cell.
  - **Cover** any existing piece (even an opponent's) with a **larger** one.
- A player **wins** by aligning **three visible pieces** of their own in a straight line â€” horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Covered pieces can re-emerge later, so bluffing and memory play a key role!
